# Prod-EdmondsOnline
<strong>EdmondsOnline</strong>

<strong>The project started to help the people of Edmonds during these times. <br>
The EdmondsOnline.com project started with the intent of helping people:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Communicate their needs</li>
<li>Organize and schedule store runs to pick up items people needed <br>
(this would minimize people going into stores and tell us what people are running low on)</li>
<li>Support local merchants by listing their take-out specials and contact info</li>
<li>Gather data on the current COVID-19 situation and present it in once place</li>
<li>Provide a platform for people to talk about how they are doing and reach out if they need anything</li>
</ul>
